# Webdev-task1

## Introduction
Welcome to the first task of Radiance Web-dev Vertical. In this task, we'll focus on the fundamentals of web development that we covered in the 1st Workshop.This week tasks will be based on the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It will comprise of making simple games like TIC-TAC-TOE or SUDOKU. 

**Note** : You have to choose any one of them. (In case you have time why not try your hands on both, believe me it's fun üòÉüòÉ) 

## TIC-TAC-TOE

The task is to build a [TIC-TAC-TOE game](https://playtictactoe.org/) , a multi-player classic game where both players will have to choose between X or O .The first player to complete a diagonal, vertical or a horizontal blocks wins the game.

### Tasks

- **Task 1**: Implement a two-player mode that allows two people to compete against each other.
- **Task 2**: Add a single-player mode that allows users to play with an intelligent bot that never loses.
- **Task 3**: Add an option to select which shape to begin with (X/O).
- **Task 4:** In single-player mode, add an option to choose who will start first - computer or player.
- **Extras:** You may keep a record of scores and use player names for interactivity.


## SUDOKU

[Sudoku](https://sudoku.com/) is a logic-based puzzle game .The aim of the Sudoku puzzle is to put in a numerical digit from 1 through 9 in each
cell of a 9√ó9 grid made up of 3√ó3 sub-grids (called "block‚Äù), starting with various digits given in some cells (the "givens") with the others empty; each row, column, and block must contain only one instance of each numeral.

Complexity of the algorithm that are used in building are divided into two parts.
- One is the complexity of the algorithm to generate the complete grid. We discover the randomness of generating complete grid increases when the complexity increases, that is, the randomness higher and the complexity greater.
- Second, is the algorithm to assign numbers in grid and check for each row , column and block and declare the final result .

### Tasks

- **Task 1**: Implement a Sudoku game. (The board may remain the same every time).
- **Task 2**: Implement a board generator and generate a random board in every game. You may use backtracking or naive approaches to generate the board.
- **Task 3:** Add a timer to the game, where the user may select a particular time to complete the game within it. **Bonus**: As the time reaches 0, the user can be warned about the time running out.
- **Task 4:** Warning the user about incorrect inputs and user engagement.
- **Extras:** To make the game more engaging, you may provide hints if the user is stuck for like 10-20 seconds.

## Deadline:
The deadline of the above task is:
- 7th March. [First Yearites] 
- 11th March [Second Yearites] 

## Instructions to Submit

**Note** : The project must contain three files `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css` and other static files like images only.

-   Fork the project to your GitHub account.
-   Clone it in your system.
-   Create a folder with your github username in your cloned local repository.
-   Complete the task by adding all the required files of your project in your folder.
-   When done, commit your work locally and push it to origin.
-   Deploy your game online.
-   Make a pull request to our repository with proper description and url where you have deployed your game.
-   Let us review your pull request.

## Judging

The evaluation would be done mainly on the following basis:
1. User Interface and User Experience
2. Authenticity and readability of the code
3. Completion of mentioned tasks
4. Bonus Points for implementing extra features depending on your creativityüòâ
